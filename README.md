Visit this  Site : https://codebyharii.github.io/Ai-powered/

An end-to-end AI & ML powered platform that predicts crop yield using soil data, weather conditions, and vegetation indices. Designed for farmers, agri-startups, researchers, and precision-farming systems.

🚀 Overview

This project provides accurate crop-yield predictions using machine learning models trained on soil nutrients, rainfall, temperature, and NDVI (satellite vegetation index).
It includes:

🧠 Machine Learning Model — Random Forest / XGBoost based prediction

🌐 FastAPI Backend — REST API for ML inference

💻 Frontend UI — Enter inputs & view predictions

🗂️ Data Pipeline — Preprocessing, feature engineering, EDA

🐳 Docker Setup — Containerized frontend + backend

📊 Optional Database Support — Postgres/SQLite for storing predictions

📦 Modular Architecture — Easy to extend with new crops & datasets
